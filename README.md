## Abstract
  In this project I was tasked to create a react application. The API that I pulled from was [here](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-nba), once I got an API key I tested the API with postman to verify the information was what I needed. I then planned out an HTML wireframe and component structure. The goal was to creat and application that allows a user to browse NBA teams, look at thier rosters, and save indiviual basketball cards. Another use of this application would be to check the rosters on each team. A user can filter the teams by west or east confrence and the page will only display the appropriate teams. Once a card has been saved you can view that card in the "My Cards" section where you can also delete a card from your own saved collection.

## Project Goals and Objectives
  The goals of this project were to showcase what I have learned in school and what I am capable of creating. Using the technologies I've learned to this point my objectives were to create a project that combines my joy of software and basketball.
  A full project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)
 
### Wins & Challenges
  - A challenge I faced was implementing react-routerv6. I was new to versoin 6 and since I was also new to react hooks, I had to learn how to implement routes and parameters so that I can create and use info in the url path. 
  - Another challenge came in the cypress testing portion of the project. Using intercepts and stubbing information so that I did not fetch information everytime I tested my user interface.
